        <p>
          A higher BMI increases the chance of developing long-term conditions,
          such as type 2 diabetes and heart disease. The BMI calculation is just
          one measure of health.
          <br />
          <br />
          It cannot tell the difference between muscle and fat. For example, if
          you have a lot of muscle, you may be classed as overweight or obese
          despite having low body fat. This is why you may get a better idea of
          your overall health from measuring your waist.
